To integrate machine learning models with Flask, you only need a basic understanding of Flask's core concepts. Here’s a breakdown of what’s necessary:

1. Basic Flask Concepts:
-> App setup: You need to know how to create a Flask application and define routes (@app.route()).
-> Routing: Handle different URL endpoints like /predict, /train, etc.
->  Request Handling: Use GET or POST requests to pass data (e.g., model inputs) to your app.
->  Rendering Templates: If you want to create a web interface, Flask templates (render_template) are helpful.
2. Handling ML Models:
->  Loading Models: Use libraries like pickle or joblib to load pre-trained ML models.
->  Data Processing: Ensure that you can take input from web forms or API requests, preprocess it, and feed it into the model.
->  Making Predictions: Call the model’s predict() method on the input data.
->  Returning Results: Send the prediction results back as a JSON response or render it in an HTML template.
3. Extensions (Optional):
->  Flask-RESTful: Useful for building APIs if you're exposing your ML model as a service.
->  Flask-WTF: If you're building a web app with forms to input data for the model.
->  Flask-CORS: To handle cross-origin requests if you're building a front-end that interacts with the Flask backend.
